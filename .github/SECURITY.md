# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to maintaining a secure codebase. At this time, we only actively support the latest version of the software. For older versions, please refer to the commit history for security patches, or consider upgrading.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it to us promptly. We will make every effort to address your concerns as quickly as possible.

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Instead, please send an email to our security team at [security@chirag127.dev](mailto:security@chirag127.dev). This email address is for security-related issues only.

Our primary repository for this project is located at: [https://github.com/chirag127/QuantumCode-Dynamic-QR-Code-Generator-Web-App](https://github.com/chirag127/QuantumCode-Dynamic-QR-Code-Generator-Web-App).

## Process

1.  Report the vulnerability by sending an email to [security@chirag127.dev](mailto:security@chirag127.dev).
2.  Please include as much of the following information as possible:
    *   The affected version and component (if known).
    *   A detailed description of the vulnerability.
    *   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   Proof-of-concept code (if available).
    *   Your suggested mitigation or fix (if any).
3.  We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**.
4.  We will investigate the vulnerability and provide a timeline for a fix.
5.  We will notify you once a fix is available and deployed, and we appreciate your assistance in making our project more secure.

We will not publicly disclose vulnerability details until a fix has been deployed. We may publicly credit the researcher who reports a genuine security vulnerability in accordance with responsible disclosure practices.

## Responsible Disclosure

We are following a responsible disclosure policy. Details will be shared only after a fix is available. If you find a vulnerability, please work with us to get it fixed. For more details on responsible disclosure, please refer to [https://www.first.org/vuln/](https://www.first.org/vuln/).
